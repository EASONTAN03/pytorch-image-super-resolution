# pytorch-image-super-resolution
PyTorch reimplementation of SRCNN and SRGAN for single-image super-resolution on the DIV2K dataset. Features a modular codebase with shared components for fair comparison between CNN- and GAN-based methods. Includes training, evaluation, and reproducibility support to validate results against the original papers.
